  <h2> Thoughts On Progrssive Enhancment </h2>
  <p> I beleive that Progressive Enhancment is a very smart approach in mnaking content for others. Just like in the article it states that it is has layers, like a cake or a M&M. The content should be accesible to all but there should be the easy layer and the actual filling. As thorughout the internet there are people who are more advanced then others. Therefore creating a website for those who only the basics and adding advanced features for those who are expereinced is a great way to develop a long lasting website. I overall think it is a smart way in approaching the development of a website.</p>

  <h2> Feedback on Final Project </h2>
  <p> I enjoyed making the project as it wrapped up everything that I have learned throughout the year. Though basic, I understand the basics of httml and css and how to intergrate into a website. When I am lost I know the pathway's of the website and can determine what to change with my code through that. I do wish I was a bit more creative but the simplicity is nice and the messae/content is understood nicely. Although more appealing features could have a been added or a differnt website formation all together. The gifs and color scheme make up for that as well. Using the skills that I have developed allow me to realize that this career path would be something I am interested in. Learning the behind the scense of how a website operates is fascinating on its on. I hope to take my skills further in this field. </p>
