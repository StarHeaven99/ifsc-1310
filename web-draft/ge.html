      <h2>Golden Expereince</h2>
      <p>Gold Experience is a close-range Stand, with a range of 2 meters from its user. Relative to other similar Stands such as Star Platinum or Crazy Diamond, Gold Experience isn't very strong, around the strength of an average human. Despite this, it is rather fast and capable of easily destroying vehicles such as cars and motorcycles. It also does the occasional kick, similar to The World. Gold Experience does, however, possess a very versatile power.</p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>Gold Experience doesn't have any personality to speak of and follows its user's commands without manifesting any will. Its Stand Cry (seemingly communicated by itself or by Giorno, alternately) is "Muda Muda Muda~!", like DIO and his Stand, The World.</p>

          <p>Gold Experience can generate a seemingly endless amount of life energy and endow that life energy into anything its fists touch. This ability translates into a variety of different effects.

          <p>Gold Experience can also infuse life energy into an already living target. In this case, the influx of life energy causes their thought processes to greatly accelerate. When Bruno Bucciarati was hit by one of Gold Experience's punches, his consciousness accelerated to such a point that he perceived everything else to move slowly. However, his body could not keep up with the sudden surge of mental speed and could hardly move, and Bucciarati had an out-of-body experience.

          <p>Inspired by Baby Face's ability to transform body parts into inert cubes, Giorno discovered that he could do the reverse and create singular body parts and organs out of inorganic matter and assimilate them into the body of an injured individual. Thus he is able to heal gruesome wounds through various means, though Giorno noted that this ability isn't actually healing, just replacing what has been damaged.
