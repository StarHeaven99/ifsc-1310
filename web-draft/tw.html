      <h2>The World</h2>
      <p>The World is an exceptionally powerful Close-range Stand much like Star Platinum as noted by Noriaki Kakyoin and Jotaro Kujo, but boasting an effective manifestation range of approximately 10 meters.Despite requiring a close distance to inflict damage, its overwhelming physical might and near unstoppable control over time undeniably make it one of the most dangerous Stands in the entire series. The World is powerful enough to make its user capable of brief flight.</p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>The World shows no particular personality, although it occasionally smiles as it pummels others, hinting that it may be a rather cruel entity that takes pleasure in causing pain.Its Stand cry, seemingly communicated by DIO, is Muda Muda Muda! (無駄 無駄 無駄!, lit. "Useless, useless, useless!")[4] The World Itself doesn't make much attempts at speech. In the anime, The World makes grunting noises while fighting Star Platinum, and in the English dub, the mumbling sounds are replaced with growling sounds.</p>

          <p>The World's power is its ability to stop time, allowing only itself, DIO and anyone with the same power, to act within the duration of stopped time.[7]DIO is able to use this ability consistently, as shown as he is able to stop time with little to no fatigue, although this might be due to his vampiric nature or greater experience with his Stand.

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>The World possesses phenomenal strength, senses, precision, and incredible speed, being able to easily punch Kakyoin right through his abdomen and match Star Platinum in combat. DIO claims that The World is even stronger and faster than Star Platinum since it bested the latter in a clash of rapid punches between the two. However, it is unclear if this is an aspect of DIO's vampiric nature or simply having greater experience with his Stand. Its main offense is generally characterized by a flurry of speedy punches and the occasional kick.
