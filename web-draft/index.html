      <h2>Introduction to Stands</h2>
      <p>Stands are defined as personifications of "life energy" (although it's later changed to "spiritual energy") whose abilities are given visual form. When first presented, the term is written as "Stand" (幽波紋スタンド Sutando), with change the pronunciation of what literally means "Ghostly Ripple" (幽波紋 Yūhamon) in kanji.</p>
      <h3>Stand Users</h3>
      <p>The Stand is created from someone's psyche, which includes not only humans but also other living creatures. That individual is referred to as the Stand User. The User then gives their Stand a name and uses it for various purposes.</p>

          <p>Gold Experience is a humanoid Stand of slender build and average height, like Giorno. The top of its head is similar to that of a typical helmet of a soldier with a ladybug-like design, with curved markings similar to the letter J coming down from the eyes on both sides. There are stylized wings on its shoulders and large ladybugsW all over its body, which seem to parallel the ladybug emblems present on Giorno's design.

          <p>A humanoid Stand, The World is tall and has a very muscular build. It bears a striking resemblance to DIO in terms of appearance. It wears a headpiece covering its face to the end of its nose, slanting at a steep angle from the base of its forehead to a peak situated above the rear of its head by about half its height, leaving the face of an inverted triangle visible to the front; somewhat similar to the Red Crown of Lower EgyptW.
