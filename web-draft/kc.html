      <h2>King Crimson</h2>
      <p>King Crimson is one of the more impressive Stands featured in the series. Both physically strong and possessing the ability to erase time and predict the future, King Crimson is described as invincible against all other Stands whose powers do not affect time.</p>
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>King Crimson embodies Diavolo's personality in its entirety, as he frequently speaks through his stand. Aside from that, its face frequently possesses an angry or irritated expression, though on rare occasions, it also shows a maniacal grin when certain events fall in Diavolo's favor, such as when he gets his hands on the Arrow. It also appears to hiss like a snake whenever summoned. "Vinegar Doppio" or as "Diavolo's" second personality is also the user of this Stand.</p>

          <p>King Crimson's signature ability is to erase a given frame of time; it starts from the instant the ability is activated and can be made to last up to around 10 seconds.
          </p>
          <p> During this period of erased time, only Diavolo remains fully conscious and is the only one who can re-adjust his actions. Other people will be unable to experience anything that happens and will continue to act as they would have. After the effect of the ability ends, all people other than Diavolo will retain no memories of anything that happened during the erased period.</p>

          <p>Epitaph (エピタフ (墓碑銘) Epitafu) is a sub-Stand ability that acts as a complement to King Crimson's primary ability of time erasure. Diavolo and Doppio often use the forecasting ability of Epitaph to predict any incoming threat, making sneak attacks ineffective against them.

          <p> Strength: King Crimson is considerably powerful, with Diavolo preferring precise strikes at full power to kill and maim instead of rapid barrages like other Close-Range Stands. It is strong enough to slice off limbs and impale people in an instant, making it perfect for silent assassinations. </p>
